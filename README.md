The datasets required for this U-NET model were extracted and formatted using the Google Colab notebook named:

gee_data_export_all_final_py.ipynb

The extracted datasets can then be accessed and prepared into an analysis ready format and subsequently used to train the defined U-NET model architecture using the Google Colab notebook named:

gee_data_access_run_model.ipynb
